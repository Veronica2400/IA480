# Data Source
The data on global cybersecurity threats was retrieved from Kaggle.

# Data Description
This dataset contains global cybersecurity threat data from 2015 to 2024, including variables such as attack type, target industry, affected users, security vulnerabilities, incident resolution time, attack source, and financial loss.

# Objective
To analyze global cybersecurity threat data and identify the main factors, such as attack type, target industry, and resolution time, that affect the financial loss from cyber incidents. The goal is to find patterns and insights that can help predict financial impact and improve future cybersecurity efforts.

# Target Variable
Financial loss (in million dollars)

# Key Predictor Features:
- Country
- Number of affected users
- Year
- Attack type
- Target industry
- Defense mechanism used

# Training Process
The model was trained using the quick build method with default settings which is embedded within Amazon Canvas.

# Model Evaluation
The model typically predicts a value within ±29.55 million dollars of the actual financial loss value.

# Model Performance
The model's performance was modest, achieving an accuracy of 29.55% and an R² value of -7.115%. The model's results could have been improved with a better dataset and more time to refine and optimize the model.
